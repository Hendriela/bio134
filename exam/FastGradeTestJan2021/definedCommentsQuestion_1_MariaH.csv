bf582b40,1,4.0,b. subdivides string at start codon
14bbc496,1,0.0,c
14ca26cf,1,2.0,c. correct output format meaning its a list of strings
096dde3e,1,-0.5,c2. output length incorrect but general
690435bf,1,0.0,z
19179009,1,-2.0,b2. subdivision not general
7f4f4bf2,1,0.0,a0. no groups of 3
f416ccc8,1,-2.0,a2. creates groups of three at every index instead of every 3rd
08e26791,1,1.0,c1. elements in list are sublists instead of strings
ae95d4db,1,1.0,b1. failed subdivion at start codon
d37a0830,1,0.5,c1. prints codons instead of collecting to list
bf4757bb,1,-0.5,c2. did not print the variable
df15dc77,1,-0.5,a1. the last two elements are not length 3
ebd37337,1,3.0,b1. does not include start codon
4a6bff88,1,1.5,c1. printed list is a slice of the original list
823d1cf6,1,0.0,b0. no subdivision attempted
d6e416c2,1,-2.0,b2. subdivision fails if more ATGs are present
7bd8d51f,1,2.0,b1. identifies start codon but no subdivision
89e1fce8,1,-2.0,b3. adds the second ATG instance more than once
cac328eb,1,2.0,b1. subdivision starts correctly but is missing a break so that the index goes out of range
d12d669e,1,-1.0,c3. list of codon sorted
f18f2978,1,-3.0,b3. it only includes unique codons that have alternating bases
deca229a,1,0.0,c0. empty final list
945a9f4f,1,1.0,a1. plausible attempt to create groups of 3
bf76f2dd,1,0.0,a3. no groups of 3 belonging to the original string
