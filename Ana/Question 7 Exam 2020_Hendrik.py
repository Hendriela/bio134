Question 7
aminoacids=['alanine','cysteine','aspartic acid','glutamic acid',
'phenylalanine','glycine','histidine','isoleucine','lysine',
'leucine','methionine','asparagine','proline','glutamine',
'arginine','serine','threonine','valine','tryptophan','tyrosine']
The list aminoacids contains the 20 standard amino acids. In addition to their full name, there
is a standard one letter code, that uniquely identifies the amino acids.
Write a program to create your own one letter code. Use the following rules for this:
1. If the first letter of the name is unique, use it as a one letter code (eg P for Proline)
2. For the other amino acids that share the first letter:
a. Assign the first letter as code to the amino acid with the shortest name in the
group of amino acids with the same first letter (eg. ['Glycineâ€™, Glutamic acid',
'Glutamine']: G for Glycine). You may assume that there is exactly one shortest
name per group.
b. For the remaining amino acids: assign them in alphabetical order to the next
free letter in the alphabet (eg. B for Arginine).
The program should print your one letter code in the following manner (note the alphabetical
order in the one letter code and the capital letter in the full names):
A Alanine
B Arginine
C Cysteine
D Asparagine
E Aspartic acid
F Glutamic acid
G Glycine
H Histidine
I Isoleucine
J Glutamine
K Leucine
L Lysine
M Methionine
N Phenylalanine
O Threonine
P Proline
Q Tryptophan
R ---
S Serine
T Tyrosine
U ---
V Valine
W ---
X ---
Y ---
Z ---
Your program should still work if amino acids were named differently or if there was a
different number of amino acids. You may assume that there are not more than 26 amino
acids.
Please note, that the points you get for this question are largely based on your printed output
and you will be given 0 points if the program prints nothing. In case not all the printed values
are correct, you may still get part of the points.

This exercise was indeed quite tricky.

I am posting my solution below. 

Notice how I separated two actions, that are logically contained, into two small functions: find_aa(), which returns all 
amino acids that start with a given letter, and get_shortest_aa(), which returns the shortest string from a list of 
strings/amino acids. This is not necessary, but doing this helps keep the code organized and clea. Extracting logical 
steps of your program helps you to get the processes of your program ordered in your head and your code is easier to 
read, and if you have to do the same action multiple times (like finding all amino acids with a given letter), it also 
makes your code shorter because you only have to write it once.
